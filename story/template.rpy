    "Divine punishment."
    "Ever heard of it? It's the kind of thing that happens when you've fucked up really bad."
    "Some say it doesn't exist, others do. But can you really blame anyone for thinking how they do? After all, you've either experienced it, or you haven't."
    "I don't really believe in it personally, but exactly what else could have happened?"
    "I don't know what I am being punished for. I don't even know if I am the one being punished. The only thing I know is that something divine happened that day."
    "That day was at the start of our final school year, our debut as seniors on Tina Koya High."
    "The 8th of August is the date where it all began."
